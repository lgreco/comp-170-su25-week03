# COMP 170 SU25 WEEK 03

This assignment has two parts: a coding part based on current material we discuss in class and a reflection part to evaluate work you have already submitted.

# Finals week policy

There is no final exam for the course. There will be a final assignemnt that will be published the week before finals and will be due the week of finals. Additionally, 8 students in the course will be invited randomly to a brief meeting with the instructor during the course's final exam slot. The final exam slot for this course is on Tuesday, August 5, 2025 from 11 AM to 1 PM. If you are selected for a brief meeting, we'll spend about 15 minutes during the final exam slot to review your work. This interview will cover coding practices based on your past assignments. It is meant as a checkpoint to ensure that you have internalized the work you submitted.

# Code

## Right triangle

Write a function `draw_right_triangle` that draws a right angle triangle whose height is specified as a parameter to the function.

## Diamond shape

Write a function `draw_diamond` that draws a diamond shape of a specified height passed as a parameter to the function.

## Compound interest

Write a function `compound_interst` that computes the compound interest for a given amount, a given annual interest rate, and a given period of time. For example, over a 5 year period, an initial investment of $1,000, earning 5% interest will accumulate as follows:

* 1st year: $1,000 principal + $1,000 x 0.05 interest = $1,050
* 2nd year: $1,050 principal + $1,050 x 0.05 interest = $1,102.50
* 3rd year: $1,102.50 principal + $1,102.50 x 0.05 interest = $1,157.62
* 4th year: $1,157.62 principal + $1,157.62 x 0.05 interest = $1,215.50
* 5th year = $1,215.50 principal + $1,215.50 x 0.05 interest = $1,276.27

The amount of $1,276.27 is the compound interest for this specific example. Your function *should not use* any exponential operations.

# Reflect

Review the posted solutions from the previous assignment. Compare the posted solutions with your solutions. Notice the differences between your code and the solutions code and describe them. Trivial differences like the names of variables are not that important -- unless your names are really - I mean, *really -* weird.
