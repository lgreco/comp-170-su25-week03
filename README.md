# COMP 170 SU25 WEEK 03

For this week's assignment focus on parameterized functions.

## Right triangle

Write a function `draw_right_triangle` that draws a right angle triangle whose height is specified as a parameter to the function.

## Diamond shape

Write a function `draw_diamond` that draws a diamond shape of a specified height passed as a parameter to the function.

## Compound interest

Write a function `compound_interst` that computes the compound interest for a given amount, a given annual interest rate, and a given period of time. For example, over a 5 year period, an initial investment of $1,000, earning 5% interest will accumulate as follows:

* 1st year: $1,000 principal + $1,000 x 0.05 interest = $1,050
* 2nd year: $1,050 principal + $1,050 x 0.05 interest = $1,102.50
* 3rd year: $1,102.50 principal + $1,102.50 x 0.05 interest = $1,157.62
* 4th year: $1,157.62 principal + $1,157.62 x 0.05 interest = $1,215.50
* 5th year = $1,215.50 principal + $1,215.50 x 0.05 interest = $1,276.27
